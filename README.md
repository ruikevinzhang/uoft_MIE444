This project is designed to develop a prototype rover that carries out a set of tasks autonomously (no human control/interaction is allowed for the final design, only partial marks may be given if the rover is not completely autonomous).

 - Solidworks for Mechanical Design 
 - 3 D printing for Prototyping 
 - Utilize Ardunio (C programming) 
 - Matlab for localizations and naviagtion (determining the shortest distance to destination) 
 
Result: The first in the class, only group scored full marks in the final milestone.
